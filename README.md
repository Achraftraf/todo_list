# todo_list
I've built a Spring Boot to-do list project that includes task descriptions. Each task, defined by a 'Task' entity, has a title, a description, and a completion status. The Spring Data JPA repository enables smooth database interaction. With RESTful API endpoints, users can add, view, and manage tasks efficiently, enhancing task organization.
